Personal Profile
================

I grew tired of deciphering the subtle difference between `.profile`,
`.bash_profile`, and `.bashrc` on every new system, so I created this.
To install, download and run `install.sh`. **The script will overwite
existing profile files.** On systems with curl:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mdavidn/profile/master/install.sh | sh
```
